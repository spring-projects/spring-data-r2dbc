The Spring Data R2DBC project applies core Spring concepts to the development of solutions that use the https://r2dbc.io[R2DBC] drivers for relational databases.
We provide a `DatabaseClient` as a high-level abstraction for storing and querying rows.

This document is the reference guide for Spring Data - R2DBC Support.
It explains R2DBC module concepts and semantics and.

This section provides some basic introduction to Spring and databases.

== Learning Spring

Spring Data uses Spring framework's http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/core.html[core] functionality, including:

* http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans[IoC] container
* http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/core.html#validation[type conversion system]
* http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/core.html#expressions[expression language]
* http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#jmx[JMX integration]
* http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#dao-exceptions[DAO exception hierarchy].

While you need not know the Spring APIs, understanding the concepts behind them is important.
At a minimum, the idea behind Inversion of Control (IoC) should be familiar, and you should be familiar with whatever IoC container you choose to use.

The core functionality of the R2DBC support can be used directly, with no need to invoke the IoC services of the Spring Container.
This is much like `JdbcTemplate`, which can be used "'standalone'" without any other services of the Spring container.
To leverage all the features of Spring Data R2DBC, such as the repository support, you need to configure some parts of the library to use Spring.

To learn more about Spring, you can refer to the comprehensive documentation that explains the Spring Framework in detail.
There are a lot of articles, blog entries, and books on the subject.
See the Spring framework http://spring.io/docs[home page] for more information.

[[get-started:first-steps:what]]
== What is R2DBC?

https://r2dbc.io[R2DBC] is the acronym for Reactive Relational Database Connectivity. R2DBC is an API specification initiative that declares a reactive API to be implemented by driver vendors for accessing their relational databases.

Part of the answer why R2DBC was created is the need for a non-blocking application stack to handle concurrency with a small number of threads and scale with fewer hardware resources.
This need cannot be satisfied with reusing standardized relational database access APIs - namely JDBC – as JDBC is a fully blocking API.
Attempts to compensate for blocking behavior with a `ThreadPool` are limited useful.

The other part of the answer is that most applications use a relational database to store their data.
While several NoSQL database vendors provide reactive database clients for their databases, migration to NoSQL is not an option for most projects.
This was the motivation for a new common API to serve as a foundation for any non-blocking database driver.
While the open source ecosystem hosts various non-blocking relational database driver implementations, each client comes with a vendor-specific API so a generic layer on top of these libraries is not possible.

[[get-started:first-steps:reactive]]
== What is Reactive?

The term, reactive refers to programming models that are built around reacting to change, availability, and processability — network components reacting to I/O events, UI controllers reacting to mouse events, resources being made available and others.
In that sense, non-blocking is reactive, because, instead of being blocked, we are now in the mode of reacting to notifications as operations complete or data becomes available.

There is also another important mechanism that we on the Spring team associated with reactive and that is non-blocking back pressure.
In synchronous, imperative code, blocking calls serve as a natural form of back pressure that forces the caller to wait.
In non-blocking code, it becomes essential to control the rate of events so that a fast producer does not overwhelm its destination.

https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v{reactiveStreamsVersion}/README.md#specification[Reactive Streams is a small spec] (also https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html[adopted in Java 9]) that defines the interaction between asynchronous components with back pressure.
For example, a data repository (acting as {reactiveStreamsJavadoc}/org/reactivestreams/Publisher.html[`Publisher`]) can produce data that an HTTP server (acting as {reactiveStreamsJavadoc}/org/reactivestreams/Subscriber.html`[`Subscriber`]) can then write to the response.
The main purpose of Reactive Streams is to let the subscriber control how quickly or how slowly the publisher produces data.

[[get-started:first-steps:reactive-api]]
== Reactive API

Reactive Streams plays an important role for interoperability. It is of interest to libraries and infrastructure components but less useful as an application API, because it is too low-level.
Applications need a higher-level and richer, functional API to compose async logic — similar to the Java 8 Stream API but not only for tables.
This is the role that reactive libraries play.

https://github.com/reactor/reactor[Project Reactor] is the reactive library of choice for Spring Data R2DBC.
It provides the https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Mono.html[`Mono`] and https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html[`Flux`] API types to work on data sequences of `0..1` (`Mono`) and `0..N` (`Flux`) through a rich set of operators aligned with the ReactiveX vocabulary of operators.
Reactor is a Reactive Streams library and, therefore, all of its operators support non-blocking back pressure.
Reactor has a strong focus on server-side Java. It is developed in close collaboration with Spring.

Spring Data R2DBC requires Project Reactor as a core dependency but it is interoperable with other reactive libraries via Reactive Streams.
As a general rule, a Spring Data R2DBC repository accepts a plain `Publisher` as input, adapts it to a Reactor type internally, uses that, and returns either a `Mono` or a `Flux` as output.
So, you can pass any `Publisher` as input and you can apply operations on the output, but you need to adapt the output for use with another reactive library.
Whenever feasible, Spring Data adapts transparently to the use of RxJava or another reactive library.
