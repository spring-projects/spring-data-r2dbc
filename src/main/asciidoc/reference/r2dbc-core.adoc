R2DBC contains a wide range of features:

* Spring configuration support with Java-based `@Configuration` classes for an R2DBC driver instance.
* `R2dbcEntityTemplate` as central class for entity-bound operations that increases productivity when performing common R2DBC operations with integrated object mapping between rows and POJOs.
* Feature-rich object mapping integrated with Spring's Conversion Service.
* Annotation-based mapping metadata that is extensible to support other metadata formats.
* Automatic implementation of Repository interfaces, including support for custom query methods.

For most tasks, you should use `R2dbcEntityTemplate` or the repository support, which both use the rich mapping functionality.
`R2dbcEntityTemplate` is the place to look for accessing functionality such as ad-hoc CRUD operations.

[[r2dbc.getting-started]]
== Getting Started

An easy way to set up a working environment is to create a Spring-based project through https://start.spring.io[start.spring.io].
To do so:

. Add the following to the pom.xml files `dependencies` element:
+
====
[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.r2dbc</groupId>
      <artifactId>r2dbc-bom</artifactId>
      <version>${r2dbc-releasetrain.version}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>

  <!-- other dependency elements omitted -->

  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-data-r2dbc</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
  </dependency>

  <!-- a R2DBC driver -->
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.r2dbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>r2dbc-h2</artifactId>
    <version>{r2dbcVersion}</version>
  </dependency>

</dependencies>
----
====

. Change the version of Spring in the pom.xml to be
+
====
[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<spring-framework.version>{springVersion}</spring-framework.version>
----
====

. Add the following location of the Spring Milestone repository for Maven to your `pom.xml` such that it is at the same level as your `<dependencies/>` element:
+
====
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>spring-milestone</id>
    <name>Spring Maven MILESTONE Repository</name>
    <url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
----
====

The repository is also https://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/data/[browseable here].

You may also want to set the logging level to `DEBUG` to see some additional information.
To do so, edit the `application.properties` file to have the following content:

====
[source]
----
logging.level.org.springframework.r2dbc=DEBUG
----
====

Then you can, for example, create a `Person` class to persist, as follows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../{example-root}/Person.java[tags=class]
----
====

Next, you need to create a table structure in your database, as follows:

====
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE person
  (id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(255),
   age INT);
----
====

You also need a main application to run, as follows:


====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../{example-root}/R2dbcApp.java[tag=class]
----
====

When you run the main program, the preceding examples produce output similar to the following:

====
[source]
----
2018-11-28 10:47:03,893 DEBUG amework.core.r2dbc.DefaultDatabaseClient: 310 - Executing SQL statement [CREATE TABLE person
  (id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(255),
   age INT)]
2018-11-28 10:47:04,074 DEBUG amework.core.r2dbc.DefaultDatabaseClient: 908 - Executing SQL statement [INSERT INTO person (id, name, age) VALUES($1, $2, $3)]
2018-11-28 10:47:04,092 DEBUG amework.core.r2dbc.DefaultDatabaseClient: 575 - Executing SQL statement [SELECT id, name, age FROM person]
2018-11-28 10:47:04,436  INFO        org.spring.r2dbc.example.R2dbcApp:  43 - Person [id='joe', name='Joe', age=34]
----
====

Even in this simple example, there are few things to notice:

* You can create an instance of the central helper class in Spring Data R2DBC (`R2dbcEntityTemplate`) by using a standard `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory` object.
* The mapper works against standard POJO objects without the need for any additional metadata (though you can, optionally, provide that information -- see <<mapping,here>>.).
* Mapping conventions can use field access.Notice that the `Person` class has only getters.
* If the constructor argument names match the column names of the stored row, they are used to instantiate the object.

[[r2dbc.examples-repo]]
== Examples Repository

There is a https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-examples[GitHub repository with several examples] that you can download and play around with to get a feel for how the library works.

[[r2dbc.connecting]]
== Connecting to a Relational Database with Spring

One of the first tasks when using relational databases and Spring is to create a `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory` object by using the IoC container.Make sure to use a <<r2dbc.drivers,supported database and driver>>.

[[r2dbc.connectionfactory]]
=== Registering a `ConnectionFactory` Instance using Java-based Metadata

The following example shows an example of using Java-based bean metadata to register an instance of `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory`:

.Registering a `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory` object using Java-based bean metadata
====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class ApplicationConfiguration extends AbstractR2dbcConfiguration {

  @Override
  @Bean
  public ConnectionFactory connectionFactory() {
    return â€¦
  }
}
----
====

This approach lets you use the standard `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory` instance, with the container using Spring's `AbstractR2dbcConfiguration`.As compared to registering a `ConnectionFactory` instance directly, the configuration support has the added advantage of also providing the container with an `ExceptionTranslator` implementation that translates R2DBC exceptions to exceptions in Spring's portable `DataAccessException` hierarchy for data access classes annotated with the `@Repository` annotation.This hierarchy and the use of `@Repository` is described in {spring-framework-ref}/data-access.html[Spring's DAO support features].

`AbstractR2dbcConfiguration` also registers `DatabaseClient`, which is required for database interaction and for Repository implementation.

[[r2dbc.drivers]]
=== R2DBC Drivers

Spring Data R2DBC supports drivers through R2DBC's pluggable SPI mechanism.
You can use any driver that implements the R2DBC spec with Spring Data R2DBC.
Since Spring Data R2DBC reacts to specific features of each database, it requires a `Dialect` implementation otherwise your application won't start up.
Spring Data R2DBC ships with dialect implementations for the following drivers:

* https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-h2[H2] (`io.r2dbc:r2dbc-h2`)
* https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-connector-r2dbc[MariaDB] (`org.mariadb:r2dbc-mariadb`)
* https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-mssql[Microsoft SQL Server] (`io.r2dbc:r2dbc-mssql`)
* https://github.com/mirromutth/r2dbc-mysql[MySQL] (`dev.miku:r2dbc-mysql`)
* https://github.com/jasync-sql/jasync-sql[jasync-sql MySQL] (`com.github.jasync-sql:jasync-r2dbc-mysql`)
* https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-postgresql[Postgres] (`io.r2dbc:r2dbc-postgresql`)
* https://github.com/oracle/oracle-r2dbc[Oracle] (`com.oracle.database.r2dbc:oracle-r2dbc`)

Spring Data R2DBC reacts to database specifics by inspecting the `ConnectionFactory` and selects the appropriate database dialect accordingly.
You need to configure your own {spring-data-r2dbc-javadoc}/api/org/springframework/data/r2dbc/dialect/R2dbcDialect.html[`R2dbcDialect`] if the driver you use is not yet known to Spring Data R2DBC.

TIP: Dialects are resolved by {spring-data-r2dbc-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/r2dbc/dialect/DialectResolver.html[`DialectResolver`] from a `ConnectionFactory`, typically by inspecting `ConnectionFactoryMetadata`.
+ You can let Spring auto-discover your `R2dbcDialect` by registering a class that implements `org.springframework.data.r2dbc.dialect.DialectResolver$R2dbcDialectProvider` through `META-INF/spring.factories`.
`DialectResolver` discovers dialect provider implementations from the class path using Spring's `SpringFactoriesLoader`.
