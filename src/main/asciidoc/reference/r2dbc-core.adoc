R2DBC contains a wide range of features:

* Spring configuration support with Java-based `@Configuration` classes  for an R2DBC driver instance.
* A `DatabaseClient` helper class that increases productivity when performing common R2DBC operations with integrated object mapping between rows and POJOs.
* Exception translation into Spring's portable Data Access Exception hierarchy.
* Feature-rich object mapping integrated with Spring's Conversion Service.
* Annotation-based mapping metadata that is extensible to support other metadata formats.
* Automatic implementation of Repository interfaces, including support for custom query methods.

For most tasks, you should use `DatabaseClient` or the repository support, which both use the rich mapping functionality.
`DatabaseClient` is the place to look for accessing functionality such as ad-hoc CRUD operations.

[[r2dbc.getting-started]]
== Getting Started

An easy way to set up a working environment is to create a Spring-based project through https://start.spring.io[start.spring.io].
To do so:

. Add the following to the pom.xml files `dependencies` element:
+
====
[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.r2dbc</groupId>
      <artifactId>r2dbc-bom</artifactId>
      <version>${r2dbc-releasetrain.version}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>

  <!-- other dependency elements omitted -->

  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-data-r2dbc</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
  </dependency>

  <!-- a R2DBC driver -->
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.r2dbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>r2dbc-h2</artifactId>
    <version>{r2dbcVersion}</version>
  </dependency>

</dependencies>
----
====

. Change the version of Spring in the pom.xml to be
+
====
[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<spring.framework.version>{springVersion}</spring.framework.version>
----
====

. Add the following location of the Spring Milestone repository for Maven to your `pom.xml` such that it is at the same level as your `<dependencies/>` element:
+
====
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>spring-milestone</id>
    <name>Spring Maven MILESTONE Repository</name>
    <url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
----
====

The repository is also https://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/data/[browseable here].

You may also want to set the logging level to `DEBUG` to see some additional information. To do so, edit the `application.properties` file to have the following content:

====
[source]
----
logging.level.org.springframework.data.r2dbc=DEBUG
----
====

Then you can, for example, create a `Person` class to persist, as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
package org.spring.r2dbc.example;

public class Person {

  private String id;
  private String name;
  private int age;

  public Person(String id, String name, int age) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  public String getId() {
    return id;
  }
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }
  public int getAge() {
    return age;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "Person [id=" + id + ", name=" + name + ", age=" + age + "]";
  }
}
----
====

Next, you need to create a table structure in your database, as follows:

====
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE person
  (id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(255),
   age INT);
----
====

You also need a main application to run, as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
package org.spring.r2dbc.example;

public class R2dbcApp {

  private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(R2dbcApp.class);

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = ConnectionFactories.get("r2dbc:h2:mem:///test?options=DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE");

    DatabaseClient client = DatabaseClient.create(connectionFactory);

    client.execute("CREATE TABLE person" +
        "(id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY," +
        "name VARCHAR(255)," +
        "age INT)")
      .fetch()
      .rowsUpdated()
      .as(StepVerifier::create)
      .expectNextCount(1)
      .verifyComplete();

    client.insert()
      .into(Person.class)
      .using(new Person("joe", "Joe", 34))
      .then()
      .as(StepVerifier::create)
      .verifyComplete();

    client.select()
      .from(Person.class)
      .fetch()
      .first()
      .doOnNext(it -> log.info(it))
      .as(StepVerifier::create)
      .expectNextCount(1)
      .verifyComplete();
  }
}
----
====

When you run the main program, the preceding examples produce output similar to the following:

====
[source]
----
2018-11-28 10:47:03,893 DEBUG ata.r2dbc.function.DefaultDatabaseClient: 310 - Executing SQL statement [CREATE TABLE person
  (id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(255),
   age INT)]
2018-11-28 10:47:04,074 DEBUG ata.r2dbc.function.DefaultDatabaseClient: 908 - Executing SQL statement [INSERT INTO person (id, name, age) VALUES($1, $2, $3)]
2018-11-28 10:47:04,092 DEBUG ata.r2dbc.function.DefaultDatabaseClient: 575 - Executing SQL statement [SELECT id, name, age FROM person]
2018-11-28 10:47:04,436  INFO        org.spring.r2dbc.example.R2dbcApp:  43 - Person [id='joe', name='Joe', age=34]
----
====

Even in this simple example, there are few things to notice:

* You can create an instance of the central helper class in Spring Data R2DBC (<<r2dbc.datbaseclient,`DatabaseClient`>>) by using a standard `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory` object.
* The mapper works against standard POJO objects without the need for any additional metadata (though you can, optionally, provide that information -- see <<mapping,here>>.).
* Mapping conventions can use field access. Notice that the `Person` class has only getters.
* If the constructor argument names match the column names of the stored row, they are used to instantiate the object.

[[r2dbc.examples-repo]]
== Examples Repository

There is a https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-examples[GitHub repository with several examples] that you can download and play around with to get a feel for how the library works.

[[r2dbc.connecting]]
== Connecting to a Relational Database with Spring

One of the first tasks when using relational databases and Spring is to create a `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory` object by using the IoC container.

[[r2dbc.connectionfactory]]
=== Registering a `ConnectionFactory` Instance using Java-based Metadata

The following example shows an example of using Java-based bean metadata to register an instance of `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory`:

.Registering a `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory` object using Java-based bean metadata
====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class ApplicationConfiguration extends AbstractR2dbcConfiguration {

  @Override
  @Bean
  public ConnectionFactory connectionFactory() {
    return â€¦;
  }
}
----
====

This approach lets you use the standard `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory` instance, with the container using Spring's `AbstractR2dbcConfiguration`. As compared to registering a `ConnectionFactory` instance directly, the configuration support has the added advantage of also providing the container with an `ExceptionTranslator` implementation that translates R2DBC exceptions to exceptions in Spring's portable `DataAccessException` hierarchy for data access classes annotated with the `@Repository` annotation. This hierarchy and the use of `@Repository` is described in {spring-framework-ref}/data-access.html[Spring's DAO support features].

`AbstractR2dbcConfiguration` also registers `DatabaseClient`, which is required for database interaction and for Repository implementation.

[[r2dbc.drivers]]
=== R2DBC Drivers

Spring Data R2DBC supports drivers through R2DBC's pluggable SPI mechanism. You can use any driver that implements the R2DBC spec with Spring Data R2DBC.
R2DBC is a relatively young initiative that gains significance by maturing through adoption.
As of this writing, the following drivers are available:

* https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-postgresql[Postgres] (`io.r2dbc:r2dbc-postgresql`)
* https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-h2[H2] (`io.r2dbc:r2dbc-h2`)
* https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-mssql[Microsoft SQL Server] (`io.r2dbc:r2dbc-mssql`)
* https://github.com/mirromutth/r2dbc-mysql[MySQL] (`dev.miku:r2dbc-mysql`)
* https://github.com/jasync-sql/jasync-sql[jasync-sql MySQL] (`com.github.jasync-sql:jasync-r2dbc-mysql`)

Spring Data R2DBC reacts to database specifics by inspecting the `ConnectionFactory` and selects the appropriate database dialect accordingly.
You can configure your own {spring-data-r2dbc-javadoc}/api/org/springframework/data/r2dbc/dialect/R2dbcDialect.html[`R2dbcDialect`] if the driver you use is not yet known to Spring Data R2DBC.

TIP: Dialects are resolved by {spring-data-r2dbc-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/r2dbc/dialect/DialectResolver.html[`DialectResolver`] from a `ConnectionFactory`, typically by inspecting `ConnectionFactoryMetadata`.
 +
You can let Spring auto-discover your `R2dbcDialect` by registering a class that implements `org.springframework.data.r2dbc.dialect.DialectResolver$R2dbcDialectProvider` through `META-INF/spring.factories`.
`DialectResolver` discovers dialect provider implementations from the class path using Spring's `SpringFactoriesLoader`.
