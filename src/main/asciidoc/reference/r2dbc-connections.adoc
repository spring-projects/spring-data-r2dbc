== Using `ConnectionFactory`

Spring obtains an R2DBC connection to the database through a `ConnectionFactory`.
A `ConnectionFactory` is part of the R2DBC specification and is a generalized connection factory.
It lets a container or a framework hide connection pooling and transaction management issues from the application code.
As a developer, you need not know details about how to connect to the database.
That is the responsibility of the administrator who sets up the `ConnectionFactory`.
You most likely fill both roles as you develop and test code, but you do not necessarily have to know how the production data source is configured.

When you use Spring's R2DBC layer, you can can configure your own with a connection pool implementation provided by a third party.
A popular implementation is R2DBC Pool.
Implementations in the Spring distribution are meant only for testing purposes and do not provide pooling.

To configure a ``ConnectionFactory``:

. Obtain a connection with `ConnectionFactory` as you typically obtain an R2DBC
  `ConnectionFactory`.
. Provide an R2DBC URL. (See the documentation for your driver
  for the correct value.)

The following example shows how to configure a `ConnectionFactory` in Java:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	ConnectionFactory factory = ConnectionFactories.get("r2dbc:h2:mem:///test?options=DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE");
----

[[r2dbc.connections.ConnectionFactoryUtils]]
== Using `ConnectionFactoryUtils`

The `ConnectionFactoryUtils` class is a convenient and powerful helper class that provides `static` methods to obtain connections from `ConnectionFactory` and close connections if necessary.
It supports subscriber ``Context``-bound connections with, for example `ConnectionFactoryTransactionManager`.

[[r2dbc.connections.SmartConnectionFactory]]
== Implementing `SmartConnectionFactory`

The `SmartConnectionFactory` interface should be implemented by classes that can provide a connection to a relational database.
It extends the `ConnectionFactory` interface to let classes that use it query whether the connection should be closed after a given operation.
This usage is efficient when you know that you need to reuse a connection.


[[r2dbc.connections.TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy]]
== Using `TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy`

`TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy` is a proxy for a target `ConnectionFactory`.
The proxy wraps that target `ConnectionFactory` to add awareness of Spring-managed transactions.

[[r2dbc.connections.ConnectionFactoryTransactionManager]]
== Using `ConnectionFactoryTransactionManager`

The `ConnectionFactoryTransactionManager` class is a `ReactiveTransactionManager` implementation for single R2DBC datasources.
It binds an R2DBC connection from the specified data source to the subscriber `Context`, potentially allowing for one subscriber connection per data source.

Application code is required to retrieve the R2DBC connection through `ConnectionFactoryUtils.getConnection(ConnectionFactory)` instead of R2DBC's standard `ConnectionFactory.create()`.
All framework classes (such as `DatabaseClient`) use this strategy implicitly.
If not used with this transaction manager, the lookup strategy behaves exactly like the common one. Thus, it can be used in any case.

The `ConnectionFactoryTransactionManager` class supports custom isolation levels that get applied to the connection.
