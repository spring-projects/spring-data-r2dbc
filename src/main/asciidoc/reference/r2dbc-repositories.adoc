[[r2dbc.repositories.intro]]
== Introduction

This chapter points out the specialties for repository support for R2DBC.
This chapter builds on the core repository support explained in <<repositories>>.
Before reading this chapter, you should have a sound understanding of the basic concepts explained there.

[[r2dbc.repositories.usage]]
== Usage

To access domain entities stored in a relational database, you can use our sophisticated repository support that eases implementation quite significantly.
To do so, create an interface for your repository, as the following example shows:

.Sample Person entity
====
[source,java]
----
public class Person {

  @Id
  private Long id;
  private String firstname;
  private String lastname;

  // … getters and setters omitted
}
----
====

.Basic repository interface to persist Person entities
====
[source]
----
public interface PersonRepository extends ReactiveCrudRepository<Person, Long> {

  // additional custom query methods go here
}
----
====

Right now, this interface serves only to provide type information, but we can add additional methods to it later.
To configure R2DBC repositories, you can use the `@EnableR2dbcRepositories` annotation.
If no base package is configured, the infrastructure scans the package of the annotated configuration class.
The following example shows how to use Java configuration for a repository:

.Java configuration for repositories
====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableR2dbcRepositories
class ApplicationConfig extends AbstractR2dbcConfiguration {

  @Override
  public ConnectionFactory connectionFactory() {
    return …;
  }
}
----
====

Because our domain repository extends `ReactiveCrudRepository`, it provides you with CRUD operations to access the entities.
Working with the repository instance is just a matter of dependency injecting it into a client.
Consequently, you can retrieve all `Person` objects would resemble the following code:

.Paging access to Person entities
====
[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration
public class PersonRepositoryTests {

    @Autowired PersonRepository repository;

    @Test
    public void readsAllEntitiesCorrectly() {

      repository.findAll()
                .as(StepVerifier::create)
                .expectNextCount(1)
                .verifyComplete();
    }
}
----
====

The preceding example creates an application context with Spring's unit test support, which performs annotation-based dependency injection into test cases.
Inside the test method, we use the repository to query the database.
We use `StepVerifier` as test aid to verify our expectations against the results.

[[r2dbc.repositories.queries]]
== Query Methods

Most of the data access operations you usually trigger on a repository result in a query being executed against the databases.
Defining such a query is a matter of declaring a method on the repository interface, as the following example shows:

.PersonRepository with query methods
====
[source,java]
----
public interface PersonRepository extends ReactiveCrudRepository<Person, Long> {

    @Query("SELECT * FROM person WHERE lastname = :lastname")
    Flux<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);                      <1>

    @Query("SELECT firstname, lastname FROM person WHERE lastname = $1")
    Mono<Person> findFirstByLastname(String lastname)                  <2>

}
----
<1> The `findByLastname` method shows a query for all people with the given last name.
The query is provided as R2DBC repositories do not support query derivation.
<2> A query for a single `Person` entity projecting only `firstname` and `lastname` columns.
The annotated query uses native bind markers, which are Postgres bind markers in this example.
====

NOTE: R2DBC repositories do not support query derivation.

NOTE: R2DBC repositories bind parameters to placeholders by index.
