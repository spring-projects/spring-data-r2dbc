[[r2dbc.core]]
= R2DBC support

The R2DBC support contains a wide range of features:

* Spring configuration support with Java-based `@Configuration` classes  for an R2DBC driver instance.
* `DatabaseClient` helper class that increases productivity when performing common R2DBC operations with integrated object mapping between rows and POJOs.
* Exception translation into Spring's portable Data Access Exception hierarchy.
* Feature-rich Object Mapping integrated with Spring's Conversion Service.
* Annotation-based mapping metadata that is extensible to support other metadata formats.
* Automatic implementation of Repository interfaces, including support for custom query methods.

For most tasks, you should use `DatabaseClient` or the Repository support, which both leverage the rich mapping functionality.
`DatabaseClient` is the place to look for accessing functionality such as ad-hoc CRUD operations.

[[r2dbc.getting-started]]
== Getting Started

An easy way to bootstrap setting up a working environment is to create a Spring-based project through https://start.spring.io[start.spring.io].

. Add the following to the pom.xml files `dependencies` element:
+
[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependencies>

  <!-- other dependency elements omitted -->

  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-data-r2dbc</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
  </dependency>

  <!-- a R2DBC driver -->
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.r2dbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>r2dbc-h2</artifactId>
    <version>{r2dbcVersion}</version>
  </dependency>

</dependencies>
----
. Change the version of Spring in the pom.xml to be
+
[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<spring.framework.version>{springVersion}</spring.framework.version>
----
. Add the following location of the Spring Milestone repository for Maven to your `pom.xml` such that it is at the same level of your `<dependencies/>` element:
+
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>spring-milestone</id>
    <name>Spring Maven MILESTONE Repository</name>
    <url>http://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
----

The repository is also http://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/data/[browseable here].

You may also want to set the logging level to `DEBUG` to see some additional information. To do so, edit the `application.properties` file to have the following content:

[source]
----
logging.level.org.springframework.data.r2dbc=DEBUG
----

Then you can create a `Person` class to persist:

[source,java]
----
package org.spring.r2dbc.example;

public class Person {

  private String id;
  private String name;
  private int age;

  public Person(String id, String name, int age) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  public String getId() {
    return id;
  }
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }
  public int getAge() {
    return age;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "Person [id=" + id + ", name=" + name + ", age=" + age + "]";
  }
}
----

Next, you need to create a table structure in your database:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE person
  (id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(255),
   age INT);
----

You also need a main application to run:

[source,java]
----
package org.spring.r2dbc.example;

public class R2dbcApp {

  private static final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(R2dbcApp.class);

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new H2ConnectionFactory(H2ConnectionConfiguration.builder()
                                .url("mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=10")
                                .build());

    DatabaseClient client = DatabaseClient.create(connectionFactory);

    client.execute()
            .sql("CREATE TABLE person" +
                    "(id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY," +
                    "name VARCHAR(255)," +
                    "age INT)")
            .fetch()
            .rowsUpdated()
            .as(StepVerifier::create)
            .expectNextCount(1)
            .verifyComplete();

    client.insert()
            .into(Person.class)
            .using(new Person("joe", "Joe", 34))
            .then()
            .as(StepVerifier::create)
            .verifyComplete();

    client.select()
            .from(Person.class)
            .fetch()
            .first()
            .doOnNext(it -> log.info(it))
            .as(StepVerifier::create)
            .expectNextCount(1)
            .verifyComplete();
  }
}
----

When you run the main program, the preceding examples produce output similar to the following:

[source]
----
2018-11-28 10:47:03,893 DEBUG ata.r2dbc.function.DefaultDatabaseClient: 310 - Executing SQL statement [CREATE TABLE person
  (id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(255),
   age INT)]

----

Even in this simple example, there are few things to notice:

* You can create an instance of the central helper class in Spring Data R2DBC, <<r2dbc.datbaseclient,`DatabaseClient`>>, by using a standard `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory` object.
* The mapper works against standard POJO objects without the need for any additional metadata (though you can optionally provide that information. See <<mapping-chapter,here>>.).
* Mapping conventions can use field access. Notice that the `Person` class has only getters.
* If the constructor argument names match the column names of the stored row, they are used to instantiate the object.

[[r2dbc.examples-repo]]
== Examples Repository

There is a https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-examples[GitHub repository with several examples] that you can download and play around with to get a feel for how the library works.

[[r2dbc.drivers]]
== Connecting to a Relational Database with Spring

One of the first tasks when using relational databases and Spring is to create a `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory` object using the IoC container. The following example explains Java-based configuration.

[[r2dbc.connectionfactory]]
=== Registering a `ConnectionFactory` Instance using Java-based Metadata

The following example shows an example of using Java-based bean metadata to register an instance of a `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory`:

.Registering a `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory` object using Java-based bean metadata
====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class ApplicationConfiguration extends AbstractR2dbcConfiguration {

  @Override
  @Bean
  public ConnectionFactory connectionFactory() {
    return â€¦;
  }
}
----
====

This approach lets you use the standard `io.r2dbc.spi.ConnectionFactory` instance, with the container using Spring's `AbstractR2dbcConfiguration`. As compared to registering a `ConnectionFactory` instance directly, the configuration support has the added advantage of also providing the container with an `ExceptionTranslator` implementation that translates R2DBC exceptions to exceptions in Spring's portable `DataAccessException` hierarchy for data access classes annotated with the `@Repository` annotation. This hierarchy and the use of `@Repository` is described in http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html[Spring's DAO support features].

`AbstractR2dbcConfiguration` registers also `DatabaseClient` that is required for database interaction and for Repository implementation.

[[r2dbc.drivers]]
=== R2DBC Drivers

Spring Data R2DBC supports drivers by R2DBC's pluggable SPI mechanism. Any driver implementing the R2DBC spec can be used with Spring Data R2DBC.
R2DBC is a relatively young initiative that gains significance by maturing through adoption.
As of writing the following 3 drivers are available:

* https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-postgresql[Postgres] (`io.r2dbc:r2dbc-postgresql`)
* https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-h2[H2] (`io.r2dbc:r2dbc-h2`)
* https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-mssql[Microsoft SQL Server] (`io.r2dbc:r2dbc-mssql`)

Spring Data R2DBC reacts to database specifics by inspecting `ConnectionFactoryMetadata` and selects the appropriate database dialect.
You can configure an own `Dialect` if the used driver is not yet known to Spring Data R2DBC.

[[r2dbc.datbaseclient]]
== Introduction to `DatabaseClient`

Spring Data R2DBC includes a reactive, non-blocking `DatabaseClient` for database interaction. The client has a functional, fluent API with reactive types for declarative composition.
`DatabaseClient` encapsulates resource handling such as opening and closing connections so your application code can make use of executing SQL queries or calling higher-level functionality such as inserting or selecting data.

NOTE: `DatabaseClient` is a young application component providing a minimal set of convenience methods that is likely to be extended through time.

NOTE: Once configured, `DatabaseClient` is thread-safe and can be reused across multiple instances.

Another central feature of `DatabaseClient` is translation of exceptions thrown by R2DBC drivers into Spring's portable Data Access Exception hierarchy. See "`<<r2dbc.exception>>`" for more information.

The next section contains an example of how to work with the `DatabaseClient` in the context of the Spring container.

[[r2dbc.datbaseclient.create]]
=== Creating `DatabaseClient`

The simplest way to create a `DatabaseClient` is through a static factory method:

[source,java]
----
DatabaseClient.create(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory)
----

The above method creates a `DatabaseClient` with default settings.

You can also use `DatabaseClient.builder()` with further options to customize the client:

* `exceptionTranslator`: Supply a specific `R2dbcExceptionTranslator` to customize how R2DBC exceptions are translated into Spring's portable Data Access Exception hierarchy.  See "`<<r2dbc.exception>>`" for more information.
* `dataAccessStrategy`: Strategy how SQL queries are generated and how objects are mapped.

Once built, a `DatabaseClient` instance is immutable. However, you can clone it and build a modified copy without affecting the original instance, as the following example shows:

[source,java]
----
DatabaseClient client1 = DatabaseClient.builder()
        .exceptionTranslator(exceptionTranslatorA).build();

DatabaseClient client2 = client1.mutate()
        .exceptionTranslator(exceptionTranslatorB).build();
----

=== Controlling Database Connections

Spring Data R2DBC obtains a connection to the database through a `ConnectionFactory`.
A `ConnectionFactory` is part of the R2DBC specification and is a generalized connection factory.
It lets a container or a framework hide connection pooling and transaction management issues from the application code.

When you use Spring Data R2DBC, you can create a `ConnectionFactory` using your R2DBC driver.
`ConnectionFactory` implementations can either return the same connection, different connections or provide connection pooling.
`DatabaseClient` uses `ConnectionFactory` to create and release connections per operation without affinity to a particular connection across multiple operations.

[[r2dbc.exception]]
== Exception Translation

The Spring framework provides exception translation for a wide variety of database and mapping technologies.
This has traditionally been for JDBC and JPA. The Spring support for R2DBC extends this feature by providing implementations of the `R2dbcExceptionTranslator` interface.

`R2dbcExceptionTranslator` is an interface to be implemented by classes that can translate between `R2dbcException` and Springâ€™s own `org.springframework.dao.DataAccessException`, which is agnostic in regard to data access strategy.
Implementations can be generic (for example, using SQLState codes) or proprietary (for example, using Postgres error codes) for greater precision.

`SqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator` is the implementation of `R2dbcExceptionTranslator` that is used by default.
This implementation uses specific vendor codes.
It is more precise than the SQLState implementation.
The error code translations are based on codes held in a JavaBean type class called `SQLErrorCodes`.
This class is created and populated by an `SQLErrorCodesFactory`, which (as the name suggests) is a factory for creating SQLErrorCodes based on the contents of a configuration file named `sql-error-codes.xml` from Spring's Data Access module.
This file is populated with vendor codes and based on the `ConnectionFactoryName` taken from `ConnectionFactoryMetadata`.
The codes for the actual database you are using are used.

The `SqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator` applies matching rules in the following sequence:

1. Any custom translation implemented by a subclass. Normally, the provided concrete `SqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator` is used, so this rule does not apply. It applies only if you have actually provided a subclass implementation.
2. Any custom implementation of the `SQLExceptionTranslator` interface that is provided as the `customSqlExceptionTranslator` property of the `SQLErrorCodes` class.
3. Error code matching is applied.
4. Use a fallback translator.


NOTE: The `SQLErrorCodesFactory` is used by default to define Error codes and custom exception translations. They are looked up in a file named `sql-error-codes.xml` from the classpath, and the matching `SQLErrorCodes` instance is located based on the database name from the database metadata of the database in use. `SQLErrorCodesFactory` is as of now part of Spring JDBC. Spring Data R2DBC reuses existing translation configurations.

You can extend `SqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator`, as the following example shows:

[source,java]
----
public class CustomSqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator extends SqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator {

    protected DataAccessException customTranslate(String task, String sql, R2dbcException r2dbcex) {
        if (sqlex.getErrorCode() == -12345) {
            return new DeadlockLoserDataAccessException(task, r2dbcex);
        }
        return null;
    }
}
----

In the preceding example, the specific error code (`-12345`) is translated, while other errors are left to be translated by the default translator implementation.
To use this custom translator, you must configure `DatabaseClient` through the builder method `exceptionTranslator`, and you must use this `DatabaseClient` for all of the data access processing where this translator is needed.
The following example shows how you can use this custom translator:

[source,java]
----
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = â€¦;

CustomSqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator exceptionTranslator = new CustomSqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator();

DatabaseClient client = DatabaseClient.builder()
                            .connectionFactory(connectionFactory)
                            .exceptionTranslator(exceptionTranslator)
                            .build();
----

[[r2dbc.datbaseclient.statements]]
=== Running Statements

Running a statement is the basic functionality that is covered by `DatabaseClient`.
The following example shows what you need to include for a minimal but fully functional class that creates a new table:

[source,java]
----
Mono<Void> completion = client.execute()
        .sql("CREATE TABLE person (id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), age INTEGER);")
        .then();
----

`DatabaseClient` is designed for a convenient fluent usage.
It exposes intermediate, continuation, and terminal methods at each stage of the execution specification.
The example above uses `then()` to return a completion `Publisher` that completes as soon as the query (or queries, if the SQL query contains multiple statements) completes.

NOTE: `execute().sql(â€¦)` accepts either the SQL query string or a query `Supplier<String>` to defer the actual query creation until execution.

[[r2dbc.datbaseclient.queries]]
=== Running Queries

SQL queries can return values or the number of affected rows.
`DatabaseClient` can return the number of updated rows or the rows themselves, depending on the issued query.

The following example shows an `UPDATE` statement that returns the number of updated rows:

[source,java]
----
Mono<Integer> affectedRows = client.execute()
        .sql("UPDATE person SET name = 'Joe'")
        .fetch().rowsUpdated();
----

Running a `SELECT` query returns a different type of result, in particular tabular results. Tabular data is typically consumes by streaming each `Row`.
You might have noticed the use of `fetch()` in the previous example.
`fetch()` is a continuation operator that allows you to specify how much data you want to consume.

[source,java]
----
Mono<Map<String, Object>> first = client.execute()
        .sql("SELECT id, name FROM person")
        .fetch().first();
----

Calling `first()` returns the first row from the result and discards remaining rows.
You can consume data with the following operators:

* `first()` return the first row of the entire result
* `one()` returns exactly one result and fails if the result contains more rows.
* `all()` returns all rows of the result
* `rowsUpdated()` returns the number of affected rows (`INSERT` count, `UPDATE` count)

`DatabaseClient` queries return their results by default as `Map` of column name to value. You can customize type mapping by applying an `as(Class<T>)` operator.

[source,java]
----
Flux<Person> all = client.execute()
        .sql("SELECT id, name FROM mytable")
        .as(Person.class)
        .fetch().all();
----

`as(â€¦)` applies <<mapping-conventions,Convention-based Object Mapping>> and maps the resulting columns to your POJO.

[[r2dbc.datbaseclient.mapping]]
=== Mapping Results

You can customize result extraction beyond `Map` and POJO result extraction by providing an extractor `BiFunction<Row, RowMetadata, T>`.
The extractor function interacts directly with R2DBC's `Row` and `RowMetadata` objects and can return arbitrary values (singular values, collections/maps, objects).

The following example extracts the `id` column and emits its value:

[source,java]
----
Flux<String> names= client.execute()
        .sql("SELECT name FROM person")
        .map((row, rowMetadata) -> row.get("id", String.class))
        .all();
----

[[r2dbc.datbaseclient.mapping.null]]
.What about `null`?
****
Relational database results may contain `null` values.
Reactive Streams forbids emission of `null` values which requires a proper `null` handling in the extractor function.
While you can obtain `null` values from a `Row`, you must not emit a `null` value.
You must wrap any `null` values in an object (e.g. `Optional` for singular values) to make sure a `null` value is never returned directly by your extractor function.
****

[[r2dbc.datbaseclient.binding]]
=== Binding Values to Queries

A typical application requires parameterized SQL statements to select or update rows according to some input.
These are typically `SELECT` statements  constrained by a `WHERE` clause or `INSERT`/`UPDATE` statements accepting input parameters.
Parameterized statements bear the risk of SQL injection if parameters are not escaped properly.
`DatabaseClient` leverages R2DBC's Bind API to eliminate the risk of SQL injection for query parameters.
You can provide a parameterized SQL statement with the `sql(â€¦)` operator and bind parameters to the actual `Statement`.
Your R2DBC driver then executes the statement using prepared statements and parameter substitution.

Parameter binding supports various binding strategies:

* By Index using zero-based parameter indexes.
* By Name using the placeholder name.

The following example shows parameter binding for a query:

[source,java]
----
db.execute()
    .sql("INSERT INTO person (id, name, age) VALUES(:id, :name, :age)")
    .bind("id", "joe")
    .bind("name", "Joe")
    .bind("age", 34);
----

.R2DBC Native Bind Markers
****
R2DBC uses database-native bind markers that depend on the actual database.
If you are familiar with JDBC, then you're also familiar with `?` (question mark) bind markers.
JDBC drivers translate question mark bind markers to database-native markers as part of statement execution.

Postgres uses `$1`, `$2` and so on, SQL Server uses named bind markers prefixed with `@` as their native bind markers.
Spring Data R2DBC leverages `Dialect` implementations to expand named parameters to native bind markers at the time of query execution which gives you a certain degree of query portability across various database vendors
You can still use native bind markers if you prefer to do so.
****

The query-preprocessor unrolls named `Collection` parameters to remove the need of dynamic query creation based on the number of arguments.
Nested object arrays are expanded to allow usage of e.g. select lists.

Consider the following query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT id, name, state FROM table WHERE (name, age) IN (('John', 35), ('Ann', 50))
----

This query can be parametrized and executed as:

[source,java]
----
List<Object[]> tuples = new ArrayList<>();
tuples.add(new Object[] {"John", 35});
tuples.add(new Object[] {"Ann",  50});

db.execute()
    .sql("SELECT id, name, state FROM table WHERE (name, age) IN (:tuples)")
    .bind("tuples", tuples);
----

NOTE: Usage of select lists is vendor-dependent.

A simpler variant using `IN` predicates:

[source,java]
----
db.execute()
    .sql("SELECT id, name, state FROM table WHERE age IN (:ages)")
    .bind("ages", Arrays.asList(35, 50));
----

[[r2dbc.datbaseclient.transactions]]
=== Transactions

A common pattern when using relational databases is grouping multiple queries within a unit of work that is guarded by a transaction.
Relational databases typically associate a transaction with a single transport connection.
Using different connections hence results in utilizing different transactions.
Spring Data R2DBC includes a transactional `DatabaseClient` implementation with `TransactionalDatabaseClient` that allows you to group multiple statements within the same transaction.
`TransactionalDatabaseClient` is a extension of `DatabaseClient` that exposes the same functionality as `DatabaseClient` and adds transaction-management methods.

You can run multiple statements within a transaction using the `inTransaction(Function)` closure:

[source,java]
----
TransactionalDatabaseClient databaseClient = TransactionalDatabaseClient.create(connectionFactory);

Flux<Void> completion = databaseClient.inTransaction(db -> {

    return db.execute().sql("INSERT INTO person (id, name, age) VALUES(:id, :name, :age)")
            .bind("id", "joe")
            .bind("name", "Joe")
            .bind("age", 34)
            .fetch().rowsUpdated()
            .then(db.execute().sql("INSERT INTO contacts (id, name) VALUES(:id, :name)")
                    .bind("id", "joe")
                    .bind("name", "Joe")
                    .fetch().rowsUpdated())
            .then();
});
----
